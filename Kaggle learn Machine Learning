So, Yesterday i have started kaggle Machine Learning course with a parallel Machine learning course at Udemy. The course at the udemy were talking about NumPy, Pandas and Seaborn, it's much more theory and application based course. The Udemy course was covering the all foundation but lack of enough exercises.
Nevertheless, Kaggle course was like "Ok , you came here we will apply models, start from there go to there, yes you can do it!!! oh look how well you get that job done!!!" Ä° like the kaggle style more, but
Kaggle seems lack of basis of modelling algorithms. The course starts with Scikit for instance first application was the DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.tree. Ok. I get it. I can use the model application now but what about you tell me how this stuff works at background?
Of course i will learn the background by myself ( do not tell anyone i enjoy that way much more:)). Couldn't be some theory and mathematical explanation in there? I definitelly tell that i am a science based engineer this is the reason why this course looks superficial to me even it is not like that.

Anyways , today will cover much more modelling on kaggle. And going to complete Pandas course at Udemy and solve some NumPy exercises.

I can't wait to be a hands on data scientist , the journey is fancy rn :)

Stay with data!!(p.s. i'm planning to read the elements of statistical learning book , wish me luck!)
