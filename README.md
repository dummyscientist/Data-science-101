# Data-science-101
This repository is about a journey through a data science. It will cover from starting to the day where i will be at. Today 02/08/2020 mostly will include information about kaggle data science course and some  udemy courses information.

##Update 12/11/2020
Kaggle, Coursera and Udemy are such a lovely places but htose days i am hanging at stackoverflow and github. I have set lots of things in my mind. first things first you need to have excellent statistical skills then you need python and code understanding. After that know the algorithms. Like "What is the differences between logistic regression and gradient boost? How can i use those algorithms on different problems? How GAN works? What are the different deeplearning algorithms and benefits to certain problems?" with parallel to this problem you have to face with satan "The Feature Engineering." you can say data cleaning or etc. And you need to get your hands in the real life problems. Inspect as much problem and solution as you can, The real deal is the experience and application. After that you will come to me. Here... I love mining analyzing and automating but,heck.. there are lot to do..

Anyways, i am glad i chose data science path. I am not satisfied with the current position of myself, i will be good at it.
